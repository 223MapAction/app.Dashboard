# Contribution Guidelines of Map Action

Welcome to the contribution guidelines for the Map Action project. We're excited that you're considering contributing! These guidelines aim to help you understand how to effectively contribute to our open-source project.

## Description

Map Action is a technological innovation initiated by the consulting firm Kaicedra Consulting SAS, a malian organisation. We specialize in geolocating issues or areas of interest, mapping, monitoring, and providing databases in the fields of environment, WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene), and sustainable development. Our actions involve civil society, governments, NGOs, private or semi-private structures, etc.

In addition to our geolocation and mapping services, Map Action also integrates advanced artificial intelligence technologies. Our system uses machine learning algorithms to automatically detect the types of incidents, assess their severity, and consider potential solutions. Furthermore, we analyze the potential impacts of these incidents on the environment, thus providing valuable insights for decision-making and crisis management.

Our technology-driven and data-centric approach enables us to provide innovative and effective solutions to address the complex challenges faced by our clients. Whether it's natural resource monitoring, disaster management, or sustainable development planning, Map Action is committed to providing cutting-edge tools and analytics to help our partners make a positive impact on our world.



## Project Objective

Map Action aims to revolutionize the way environmental issues and areas of interest are identified, monitored, and addressed through the seamless integration of geolocation technologies, mapping capabilities, and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms. Our primary objectives include:

1. **Identification and Localization**: 
Utilize Map Action Mobile (The application Mobile Android & iOS) to accurately identify and localize environmental issues, such as pollution hotspots, natural resource depletion zones, and areas vulnerable to climate change.

2. **Monitoring and Tracking**:
Implement robust monitoring and tracking mechanisms to continuously monitor changes in environmental conditions and track the progress of ongoing initiatives and interventions.

3. **Risk Assessment and Prediction**:
Develop advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to assess the severity of environmental incidents, predict potential risks, and propose proactive solutions to mitigate adverse impacts.

4. **Data-driven Decision Making**: 
Provide decision-makers with actionable insights and data-driven recommendations to facilitate informed decision-making processes and optimize resource allocation for sustainable development.

5. **Collaborative Engagement**: 
Foster collaboration and engagement among stakeholders, including civil society, governments, NGOs, and private entities, to collectively address environmental challenges and promote sustainable development practices.

Through these objectives, Map Action strives to empower organizations and individuals with the tools and knowledge needed to make meaningful contributions to environmental conservation, disaster management, and sustainable development efforts worldwide.
